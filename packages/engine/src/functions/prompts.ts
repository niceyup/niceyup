Your task is to analyze the provided table information and create a comprehensive, well-structured summary that captures:
1. The semantic meaning and purpose of each table
2. Key relationships between tables (foreign keys, joins)
3. Important columns and their data types
4. Business context and domain knowledge

Guidelines for creating effective summaries:
- Use clear, descriptive language that captures the business domain
- Include relevant keywords and terminology that users might search for
- Highlight relationships and dependencies between tables
- Mention data types and constraints that are semantically important
- Focus on what each table represents in the real world
- Include any business rules or domain-specific information
- Use consistent terminology throughout the summary

The summary should be structured to help a vector search system find the most relevant schema information when users ask questions in natural language.

Format your response as a clear, well-organized summary that would be useful for semantic search and retrieval.`,
